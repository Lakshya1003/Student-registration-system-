Ok so this is kinda notes Diary for me to remember stuff;

1. How to setup virtual environment in python
   >>> python -m venv env

2. How to setup venv using uv
   >>> pip install uv
   >>> uv venv

3. How to initialize Django project

      STATIC_URL = 'static/'
      STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]  # add this line

   c. In html file load the static files using {% load static %} at the top of the file
      and then use the static files like this
